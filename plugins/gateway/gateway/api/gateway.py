@model
class Gateway:
    '''
    Provides the gateway data.
        Pattern -   contains the regex that needs to match with the requested URI. The pattern needs to produce, if is the
                    case, capturing groups that can be used by the Filters or Navigate.
        Headers -   The headers to be filtered in order to validate the navigation. Even though this might look specific for
                    http they actually can be used for any meta data that accompanies a request, it depends mostly on the
                    gateway interpretation. The headers are provided as regexes that need to be matched. In case of headers
                    that are paired as name and value the regex will receive the matching string as 'Name:Value', the name
                    is not allowed to contain ':'. At least one header needs to match to consider the navigation valid.
        Methods -   The list of allowed methods for the request, if no method is provided then all methods are considered
                    valid. At least one method needs to match to consider the navigation valid.
        Filters -   contains a list of URIs that need to be called in order to allow the gateway Navigate. The filters are
                    allowed to have place holders of form '{1}' or '{2}' ... '{n}' where n is the number of groups obtained
                    from the Pattern, the place holders will be replaced with their respective group value. All filters
                    need to return a True value in order to allow the gateway Navigate.
        Errors -    The list of errors that are considered to be handled by this Gateway entry, if no error is provided
                    then it means the entry is not solving any error navigation. At least one error needs to match in order
                    to consider the navigation valid.
        Host -      The host where the request needs to be resolved, if not provided the request will be delegated to the
                    default host.
        Protocol -  The protocol to be used in the communication with the server that handles the request, if not provided
                    the request will be delegated using the default protocol.
        Navigate -  A pattern like string of forms like '*', 'resources/*' or 'redirect/Model/{1}'. The pattern is allowed to
                    have place holders and also the '*' which stands for the actual called URI.
